# Village-Simulator-Project

This is a project I worked on with my classmates to create an interactive village game. It's a strategy game where players manage resources and build improvements to grow their village. The goal is to efficiently allocate resources, upgrade buildings, and expand the village while maintaining a balance between resource production and consumption. 

### Quick Note on This Repo

You may notice a limited amount of commits for this project. After my coding bootcamp, I duplicated the repo to my own github to respect my classmates privacy and have the ability to continue to work on and improve upon the game while maintaining the original code through my classmates repo.

## Features

* Manage various resources such as People, Lumber, Grain, Sheep, and Water.
* Build and upgrade improvements like Houses, Fields, Pastures, Lumber Mills, and Wells.
* Dynamic resource management based on the improvements built.
* Interactive map with clickable tiles to add, upgrade, or remove improvements.
* Real-time updates to resource availability and improvement levels.

## Built With

* [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en) - Provides the server-side environment for handling asynchronous operations and network requests.
* [**React**](https://react.dev/) - Used for building the dynamic user interface of the app.
* **Vanilla CSS** - Styles the application, using flexbox and media queries for responsive design.
* **ReactDOMr**
* **React State**
